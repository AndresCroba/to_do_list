# To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List application created using Python and the tkinter library.

## Features

* Add tasks to the list
* Delete tasks from the list
* Mark tasks as complete

## Installation

To install the application, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list.git
cd to-do-list
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the application, simply run the `to_do_list.py` file:

```
python to_do_list.py
```

The application will open a window with a text entry field, two buttons (Add Task and Delete Task), and a list of tasks.

To add a task, simply type the task into the text entry field and click the Add Task button. The task will be added to the list.

To delete a task, select the task in the list and click the Delete Task button. The task will be deleted from the list.

## Code Explanation

The code for the application is relatively simple. The main window is created using the `tkinter.Tk()` class. The text entry field is created using the `tkinter.Entry()` class. The buttons are created using the `tkinter.Button()` class. The list of tasks is created using the `tkinter.Listbox()` class.

The `agregar_tarea()` function is called when the Add Task button is clicked. This function gets the text from the text entry field and adds it to the list of tasks.

The `eliminar_tarea()` function is called when the Delete Task button is clicked. This function gets the selected task from the list of tasks and deletes it.

## Conclusion

This is a simple To-Do List application that can be used to keep track of your tasks. The application is easy to use and can be customized to your needs.
